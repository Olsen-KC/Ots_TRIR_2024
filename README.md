# Ots_TRIR_2024
## Objective: Use genotyping-in-thousands (GT-seq) to characterize genotypic frequencies at markers associated with adult return timing (i.e., Ots28 on chromosome 28) phenotypes in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) sampled from the Klamath Hatchery
## Sampling: 86 fin clips were sampled April 2024 from Chinook salmon with hatchery origin from the Klamath Hatchery.
## Genotyped with the SFGL GT-seq SOP. Quality filtered according to SFGL SOP.
## GT-seq_genotyping_output: initial outputs from GT-seq genotyping. marker info file and original genotypes.
## filtering_record_filtered_genotypes: QC filtering record doc, R script used for QC filtering, filtered genotypes as dataframe.
